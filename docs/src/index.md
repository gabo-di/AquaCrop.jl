# Introduction 

AquaCrop is a crop growth model developed by FAOâ€™s Land and Water Division, 
[FAO-AquaCrop](https://www.fao.org/aquacrop/en/),
to support food security and to analyze how environmental and management factors
influence crop productivity. It focuses on simulating how water availability affects 
the yield of herbaceous crops, making it ideal for situations where water is a 
primary constraint in agriculture. AquaCrop was designed to balance simplicity 
with precision and robustness. 

The original FAO's code is written in Fortran
and available on github [AquaCrop](https://github.com/KUL-RSDA/AquaCrop/). AquaCrop.jl is a julia implementation that corresponds 
to AquaCrop version 7.1, older or newer versions can have compatibility issues. 
This repository is written with the idea to be possible to interact with other libraries from the julia
ecosystem, like DatarFrames.jl, Makie.jl, StatsModels.jl, etc.
But also to complement the models in [Persefone.jl](https://persefone-model.eu)

The model is open-source available in [AquaCrop.jl](https://github.com/gabo-di/AquaCrop.jl). 
It is developed as part of the [CAP4GI project](https://cap4gi.de/en).
